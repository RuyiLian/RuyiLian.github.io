I am currently a third year PhD student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu), [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by [Prof. Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling). On June 2019, I obtained B.Sc. degree at [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.ustc.edu.cn), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn), majoring in applied mathematics. 

My primary research interests are in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, computational photography, and robotics. My current research focuses on object pose estimation from natural images and cryo-EM images. For more information, please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](http://ruyilian.github.io/files/Ruyi_Lian_SBU_CV.pdf).
